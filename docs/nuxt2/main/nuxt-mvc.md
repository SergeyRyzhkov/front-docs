A store should contain data that can be accessed throughout your application. This includes data that is used in many places, e.g. User information that is displayed in the navbar, as well as data that needs to be preserved through pages, e.g. a very complicated multi-step form.

On the other hand, you should avoid including in the store local data that could be hosted in a component instead, e.g. the visibility of an element local to a page.
